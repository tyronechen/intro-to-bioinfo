# Introduction to Bioinformatics
COMBINE Australia Introduction to bioinformatics workshop:
- When: Day 1: 15th September 11:00 – 15:00 AEST; Day 2: 16th September 11:00 – 15:00
- Where: Online via zoom (link provided upon registration)
- Cost: $20 registration – attendees will be refunded the full amount

During the workshop, we will be working with a publicly available transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) dataset and go through common steps involved in processing this data (including read quality assessment, alignment and differential gene expression). As part of this process we will be using shell to run programs and work with files, improve reproducibility with version control and create publication quality documents with latex.

At the end of the workshop you will be able to:
- Use basic shell functions
- Version control with git
- Format documents with latex
- Work with real biological data

Requirements:
- Web browser
- Zoom
- Slack
- Github account [(sign up for free here)](https://github.com)
- Command line (mac and linux users have this as terminal. [windows users can download putty](https://www.putty.org/))
